# Pawn Shop Management System - Project Plan

## 1. System Overview

The Pawn Shop Management System is designed to be a comprehensive platform for managing multiple pawn shop branches across the country, with the potential to evolve into a microfinance or banking system. The system will control:

- Employee/worker management
- Financial operations and reporting
- Customer management
- Organizational structure
- Inventory and pawned items

## 2. Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Vite.js with React and TypeScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT + OAuth2
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes (optional for future scaling)

## 3. Core Modules

### 3.1 User Portal and Authentication
- Secure login/authentication system
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Branch Staff, Financial Officer, etc.)
- Multi-factor authentication (for high-security operations)
- Audit logging for all user activities

### 3.2 Branch Management
- Branch creation and configuration
- Branch performance metrics
- Resource allocation
- Geographic mapping and analytics

### 3.3 Employee Management
- Employee profiles and performance tracking
- Payroll integration
- Attendance and scheduling
- Commission management (for loan officers)

### 3.4 Inventory System
- Item registration and categorization
- Valuation tools and algorithms
- Item status tracking (pawned, redeemed, for sale, sold)
- Automated pricing recommendations based on market data

### 3.5 Customer Management
- Customer profiles and credit history
- KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance
- Risk assessment algorithms
- Customer relationship management tools

### 3.6 Loan and Transaction Management
- Loan origination and approval workflow
- Payment processing and tracking
- Interest calculation
- Default management
- Redemption processing

### 3.7 Financial Reporting
- Real-time financial dashboards
- Regulatory compliance reporting
- Profit and loss analysis
- Cash flow management
- Tax reporting

### 3.8 Microfinance Extensions
- Small business loan processing
- Group lending capabilities
- Savings account management
- Mobile payment integration
- Credit scoring algorithms

## 4. System Architecture

The system will follow a microservices architecture to allow for:
- Independent scaling of different modules
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Better fault isolation
- Future extensibility

Core services will include:
1. Authentication Service
2. User Management Service
3. Branch Management Service
4. Inventory Service
5. Customer Service
6. Transaction Service
7. Reporting Service
8. Notification Service

## 5. Database Schema (High-Level)

- Users
- Roles
- Branches
- Employees
- Customers
- Items
- Loans
- Payments
- Transactions
- AuditLogs
- FinancialRecords

## 6. API Structure

The API will follow RESTful principles with these main endpoints:
- /auth
- /users
- /branches
- /employees
- /customers
- /inventory
- /loans
- /transactions
- /reports

## 7. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- User authentication and role management
- Basic branch management
- Employee management
- Database setup and core models

### Phase 2: Operations Management
- Inventory system
- Customer management
- Basic loan processing
- Transaction recording

### Phase 3: Financial Management
- Advanced financial reporting
- Compliance features
- Accounting integration
- Tax management

### Phase 4: Microfinance Extensions
- Savings accounts
- Business loans
- Credit scoring
- Mobile banking features

## 8. Security Considerations
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits
- Compliance with financial regulations
- Secure password policies
- IP restriction for sensitive operations
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

## 9. Scalability Strategy
- Horizontal scaling through containerization
- Caching layers for frequently accessed data
- Database sharding for larger deployments
- CDN for static assets
- Load balancing for API endpoints

## 10. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Comprehensive logging system
- Performance monitoring
- Automated backups
- Scheduled maintenance windows
- Versioning strategy for updates
